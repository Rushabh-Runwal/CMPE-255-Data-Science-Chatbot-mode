machine learning models. Winning the competition involves creating a model with the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set, which requires focusing on minimizing prediction error and maximizing generalizability.\n","\n","##Key Business Insights\n","For used car prices, key attributes typically influencing price include:\n","\n","Age of the car: Older cars typically have lower prices.\n","Mileage: Higher mileage often lowers the value.\n","\n","Brand/Make: Certain brands retain value better.\n","\n","Condition: Wear, tear, and maintenance history impact price.\n","\n","Features: Higher-end features (e.g., leather seats, advanced safety features) increase value.\n","\n","Fuel Type: Efficiency and fuel type (e.g., electric, petrol) impact resale value.\n","\n","By understanding how these variables interplay, the model will learn to estimate prices based on these influences.\n","\n","##Task Summary\n","Target variable: Price (continuous variable).\n","\n","Evaluation metric: RMSE, which penalizes large errors more severely than small ones, making it appropriate for this regression task.\n","\n","Dataset characteristics: We are
